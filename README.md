This web app requires that you have Node.js version 8 or higher. To install, learn more [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

To run locally, run `npm install`. Then run the program with the command `node index.js`. It will process the a file named `leads.json` within the directory, creating a file called `leads-deduplicate.json` in the same directory. To run different data (of the same structure) through the program, replace the `leads.json` file with one of the same name.

To Do List of Future Features:

1. Add complexity to the logging feature, indicating which records have been removed. It currently logs number of duplicate records removed.

2. Add spacing after brackets to the `leads-deduplicate.json` file.
